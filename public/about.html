<h1>More about me</h1>
<p>Born on March 5, 1992, like the most of Brazilian kids, I had the dream of being a Soccer player, where I dedicated myself a lot until I was 16 years old, where I had to decide whether to work or continue investing in my dream.</p>
<p>When I was 16 I had my first job opportunity, where I began to learn about the power of money. Then I started to become independent. I paid for my college studies, and even started studying at a university that I didn't complete. At the age of 23 I was already moving to the USA, looking for new experiences and I could open my mind to great opportunities and I heard about the IT area for the first time</p>
<p>When I was 31 I started learning to code and here I am, looking for my first job in the area that until today was the one I fell most in love with.</p>
